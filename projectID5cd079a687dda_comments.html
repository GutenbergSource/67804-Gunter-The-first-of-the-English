<HTML><BODY><i>The first of the English</i>, a historical novel taking place in the time of the Eighty Years' War, between the Dutch and the Spanish.

<p>Easy text, so have fun!

</p><p>I added this work to PG a long time ago in a Dutch translation as <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22686">Een strijd om de schatten van Alva</a></i> (A fight for the treasures of Alva), but since the translation didn't provide the original title, nor the real author, I didn't find this until now.
